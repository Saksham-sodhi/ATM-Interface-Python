# ATM-Interface-PythonðŸš€


## Overview
This is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface built using Python. The program allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system.

## Features
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit the ATM system

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x

## How It Works
1. The program initializes an ATM account with a predefined balance.
2. The user is presented with a menu to choose from different banking operations.
3. Based on the userâ€™s input, the corresponding function is executed:
   - Checking balance: Displays the current account balance.
   - Depositing money: Adds the specified amount to the balance.
   - Withdrawing money: Deducts the specified amount from the balance if funds are sufficient.
   - Exiting: Terminates the ATM session.
4. The program continues running until the user chooses to exit.
